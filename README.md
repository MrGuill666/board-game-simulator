# board-game-simulator
Project for a generic board game DSL and simulator.
The goal is to create a DSL capable of describing the mechanics of simple board games (like "Snakes and Ladders") and a simulator running a game given with the language. The handling of input, presentation, communication between players should be entirely the responsibility of the simulator and not to be described with the language.
